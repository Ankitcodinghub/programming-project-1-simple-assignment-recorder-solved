Solve problem, design solution and implement using C++

Learn how to use basic C++ constructs and manipulate C++ string class

Handle different types of input errors

Description:

Write a menu-driven program named ‚ÄúSimpleAssignmentRecorder‚Äù that will provide following menu to record user‚Äôs input assignments:

1. Enter a new assignment

2. Show the largest assignment

3. Show all assignments

4. Exit

‚Äì ‚ÄúEnter a new assignment‚Äù option will read in one simple assignment in the form: &lt;variable&gt;&nbsp; = &lt;value&gt;

such as:&nbsp; &nbsp;count = 10 or&nbsp; total = 0

It will format and print out the assignment with proper spacing.

‚Äì ‚ÄúShow the largest assignment‚Äù option will display the largest assignment that has been entered so far

‚Äì ‚ÄúShow all assignments‚Äù option will print out all entered assignments

Requirements:

1. The program must produce the same expected output as provided.

2. Array or vector or list class is not allowed. This is an assignment using string, stream, stringstream and functions.

Simple variables and string concatenation will be sufficient to solve this problem.

3. There should be no global variables. Please use only local variables and parameters instead.

4. You must define and use at least 5 functions including main() in your program

5. There must be at least one function using pass-by-reference parameters

6. Scanf and printf are not allowed (Please use C++ cin and cout and C++ formatting)

7. Handle invalid menu options such as negative or too big or even alphanumeric such as ‚Äúabc‚Äù

8. When there is no assignments available, it should display the informational message of ‚ÄúThere is no assignment.‚Äù

9. Please handle invalid menu value that is not between 1 and 4.

10. For simplicity, you can assume that the user will enter the assignment correctly with spaces.
